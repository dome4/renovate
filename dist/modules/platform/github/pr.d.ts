/**
 *  Fetch and return Pull Requests from GitHub repository:
 *
 *   1. Synchronize long-term cache.
 *
 *   2. Store items in raw format, i.e. exactly what
 *      has been returned by GitHub REST API.
 *
 *   3. Convert items to the Renovate format and return.
 *
 * In order synchronize ApiCache properly, we handle 3 cases:
 *
 *   a. We never fetched PR list for this repo before.
 *      If cached PR list is empty, we assume it's the case.
 *
 *      In this case, we're falling back to quick fetch via
 *      `paginate=true` option (see `util/http/github.ts`).
 *
 *   b. Some of PRs had changed since last run.
 *
 *      In this case, we sequentially fetch page by page
 *      until `ApiCache.coerce` function indicates that
 *      no more fresh items can be found in the next page.
 *
 *      We expect to fetch just one page per run in average,
 *      since it's rare to have more than 100 updated PRs.
